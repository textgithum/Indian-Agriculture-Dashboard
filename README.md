# Indian-Agriculture-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard during the AICTE–Shell Edunet internship to analyze India’s agriculture sector. Explored crop-wise production, seasonal trends, and regional insights using DAX, KPIs, slicers, and map visuals. Focused on sustainability through data-driven insights and BI storytelling.

# Power BI Driven Exhaustive Analysis on Indian Agriculture Sector

## Internship Experience: AICTE-Shell Edunet Foundation

I'm excited to share that I completed a 4-week internship organized by **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **AICTE** and **Shell**, focusing on **Green Skills using AI technologies**. During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and building AI-driven solutions — culminating in this Power BI project.

##  Project Overview

This project provides a deep-dive analysis into the **Indian Agriculture Sector**, offering interactive Power BI dashboards that explore:

- Crop-wise average production
- Seasonal distribution trends
- State/district-level production maps
- Year-wise variations in crop yield and area
- Economic impact visualizations

The objective is to **leverage AI & data visualization to support sustainable agricultural planning** and policy-making.

##  Key Dashboard Features

-  KPIs: Total Crops, States, Districts, Avg. Production
-  Interactive Filters: Crop, Year, Season, State
-  Maps: State-wise Production Trends
-  Graphs: Crop-Year Comparisons, Seasonal Output
-  Tooltips, slicers, and drill-downs for insights

  ##  Insights Gained
-  Production and area drastically dropped after 2020
-  Seasonal variation highly impacts output (Kharif & Rabi dominant)
-  South Indian states show consistently higher yield
-  2005 had the highest agricultural area recorded
